/*
  Variable purchaseAmount stores the purchase amount entered by the user (lines 7â€“9).
Suppose the user entered 197.55. The sales tax is 6% of the purchase, so the tax is evaluated
as 11.853 (line 11). The statement in line 12 displays the tax 11.85 with two digits after the
decimal point. Note that
  
  tax * 100 is 1185.3
  static_cast<int>(tax * 100) is 1185
  static_cast<int> (tax * 100) / 100.0 is 11.85
  
  So, the statement in line 12 displays the tax 11.85 with two digits after the decimal point.
